# Car-statistics

This repository contains code that performs some statistical tests on car data. Specifically, we look at whether there is a statistically significant difference in the fuel efficiency and cost efficiency of cars running on either gas or batteries. Additionally we consider if there is a difference for gas cars based on their class and make.

Applied methods in this script are: data manipulation with pandas, visualization with seaborn, performing z-test and t-test with scipy.stats, and performing one-way and two-way ANOVA tests.

The used datasets can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arslaan5/explore-car-performance-fuel-efficiency-data and https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fatihilhan/electric-vehicle-specifications-and-prices.
